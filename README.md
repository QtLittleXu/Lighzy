## Introduction

Lighzy is a simple and easy-to-use programming language like Python. It is strongly typed and dynamic. The reason why Lighzy do not use dynamic type like python is it could be faster and convenient to find errors, so that it is friendlier to beginner. Lighzy means "light and easy".

The project includes [lighzy-interpreter](https://github.com/QtLittleXu/lighzy-interpreter), and Lighdit that plan to develop.
